# Hi, I'm Alex a Web Developer & Coding Hobbyist

- Hi, great to see you here.
- I’m interested in computers, software & everything inbetween. 
- I’m currently learning a number of web languages (see below).
- I’m looking to collaborate on a project to further my industrial development & experience.
- You can reach me on my social media links below.

## A Quick Summary

A Web Developer equipped with a knowledgeable skill-set in multiple programming languages, hosting, user interfaces, testing and debugging processes. Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects as well as collaborate in a team setting while striving to continuously develop new skills and knowledge in the tech industry. 

## About Me

I've spent the past year updating myself on the latest languages and looking for opportunities to build upon them.

I'm self-motivated and as I prepare myself for working in this field I'm looking to work with others to continue my development. Although most of my experience has been independent I can just as easily work with groups.

I'm currently undertaking a Web Developer Bootcamp to learn new programming languages/skills & I'm more than happy to put in the time and effort to ensure I get the most out of this experience. 

As I'm continously in the process of updating my portfolio please check out my repository when you get the chance, to stay abridged of my work.
